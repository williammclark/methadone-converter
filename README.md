# Morphine Equivalent Methadone Dosage Conveter

A simple Python library for calculating opioid dosage conversions based on the mathematical formula presented by **Fudin et al.** in *The Journal of Pain Research*.

## ðŸ“˜ Background

This library implements a nonlinear formula for morphine equivalent dose conversion, originally proposed in:

> Fudin, J., et al. (2015). Mathematical Model for Methadone Conversion Examined. *Journal of Pain Research*, 8, 753â€“755. https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S95209

The formula accounts for nonlinear pharmacokinetics at higher doses, improving upon linear conversion tables.

## Formula
The following formula is applied:

Where x is the oral morphine equivalent dose.
